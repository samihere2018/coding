!---An OpenMP program in Fortran demonstrating work and sharing of variables among threads
!---the nowait clause allows threads to continue without waiting for other threads to finish the loop
!---dynamic scheduling allows threads to pick up the next available chunk of iterations when they finish their current chunk
!---static scheduling divides the iterations into equal sized chunks and assigns them to threads. Each thread does exactly the same number of iterations. 
!---Compilation: gfortran -fopenmp -o dummyname workshare2.f90
!---This program uses the trapezoidal rule to compute the integral of a function using OpenMP for parallelisation.
